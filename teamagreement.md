 - Ian has quality work.
 - Layton is a good helper, and quality work.
 - Mason is good at trying new things.

 - Marissa's strength is teamwork
2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
 - Working in pairs on different sections of code.
 - Project Manager: makes sure things work.

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
 -  Everyone has a list of tasks in Trello, with another list of tasks that will need to be completed after someone has finished their
 current tasks. Once someone completes a task they can drag another one from the list into their list.

## Conflict Plan:
1. What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
 - In the event of conflict the other team members will vote on who they think is right. In the event of a tie then we go to Ms. King and present it to her.
2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
 - Limit them on a certain number of tasks per week
3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
 - Rate the tasks by difficulty in the Trello, and have the project managers help anyone who's struggling. Have catchup days to debugg
 and talk about any difficulties with the coding.
4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
 - Offer to help them
5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
 - Let Ms. King know
