Music Filter

1. The idea is to use the spotify api, and allows the user to filter the types of music they want to find or listen to. Then, they press a button and songs that match that filter or keyword pop up on the screen, using bootstrap cards. 

2. The problem it solves is that it finds music that you won't listen to, when you canâ€™t find the name of the song or a song you want to listen to. Or when you just want to listen to a certain genre of music, it only gives you that genre. 

3. The minimum project requirement is an application that sends back songs on bootstrap cards.
